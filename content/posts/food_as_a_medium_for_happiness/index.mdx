Whether we like it or not, everyone has their own relationship with food.

Personally, I love food; I think I love it so much that I wouldn't be able to live without it. To be fair, no one can really live without food, but
that doesn't stop me from talking about my love for it.

Honestly, my love for food started as a kid when I decided that enough was enough and
I couldn't wait for my mother to cook me bacon. So as an 8 year old, I got on a stool, took out the bacon, heated up the pan, and surprisingly
did not burn my bacon. Afterwards, I realized that bacon wasn't the only thing I was limited to eating. Discovering the Food Network and Alton Brown's Good Eats,
which for those of you who haven't watched it; is akin to being in a science class for cooking, I began my slow and tortuous descent into home cooking. Sixteen years later
and many burned cookies, salty soups, and fire alarms sent off, I am here ready to share my cooking with the world.
