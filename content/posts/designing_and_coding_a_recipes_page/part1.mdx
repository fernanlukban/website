One of my main goals of this blog is to be able to share my food recipes with anyone and everyone. As my digital wall in the vast cityscape of the internet,
my blog should not only house my favorite recipes, but also show them off. Since I'm using Gatsby for my blog, a simple post with a unordered list, some pictures,
and a list of steps would be suffice, but we're not here to do stuff that would suffice - we're here to do stuff big. 

So, we're going to design and code a recipes page from the ground up: creating the data model to rendering each individual post. I think this will not only be a good test of my writing skills,
but I'll also be able to test my problem solving, system design, and general coding since I haven't done anything like this in a while.

The most important thing to think about is: how will this custom recipes page make my life easier? If it doesn't, then why would I create one when making a regular blog post is probably easier?
Since I like to think about these things in terms of workflows or processes, it's probably good to imagine what my ideal workflow for recording a new recipe and adding it to the blog would be like.
